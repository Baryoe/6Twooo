# Description
Over the past decades, millions of Africans have immigrated to the USA and thousands have settled in New York City. This map will attempt to interactively display African Immigrants living in New York City Boroughs. Utilizing demographics data provided by NYC Open Data, this map will make known the population of African Immigrants, household size, countries of origin, cultural affiliation, population in local school districts, in addition to association of said population with universities, commercial areas, airports, subway lines and school districts. The end goal is to develop a profile of the African immigrant group in NY City boroughs. 

## Why I made this Map

I made this map to make information available that would be helpful to African Immigrant populations. As this group is very diverse, this information can be helpful for cultural, academic research, health initiatives and philanthropy to list a few.
I imagine a hypothetical situation, in which a recent college graduate from the western African Country of Senegal (French Speaking), was awarded an academic scholarship to pursue a law degree from a university in the NYC area.   This map would provide sufficient information to assist this new college graduate with helpful information, such as location of West African immigrants from Senegal residing in NYC, locations of Universities in proximity to this population, subway transportation that serves this borough, student housing, international airports, Senegalese cuisines, place of worship, immigration offices etc.

### What I would've done with more time

With more time I would have arranged the data such that all African Immigrant populations database would be searchable by country, ethnicity, language and year of immigration; Additionally, I would include skill sets or education of respective groups, social affiliations, religions, language translators, immigrant owned companies and services, NY City and federal social services.
